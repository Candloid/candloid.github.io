## GitHub Repos to Show
Here are a couple of `GitHub` repositories that I would like to show you in `Java` and `Python`.

### [auto_api](https://github.com/Candloid/auto_api)
This project was meant to automate the endpoint creation process in a generic way for `Python` classes. The functions in the class will be walked through and added as parameterizable endpoints in `Flask` with a nice `JSON` settings file for `Postman` ready for use to test.

### [bencode](https://github.com/Candloid/bencode)
This project is `Python` library to encode and decode in `Bencode`. [Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode) is a legacy encoding and signaling style used in peer-to-peer communication.

### [personalBudgetManager](https://github.com/Candloid/pbm)
This project is part of an educational effort for creating a GUI `Java` interface to interact with a `MySQL` database.

### [QubeR](https://github.com/Candloid/QubeR)
This project is an `Android mobile` app that is developed on `Android Studio` with the help of a team. It takes 3 QR codes and blends them into a single one. Yes, you can just snap a single QubeR code and get 3 QR codes that are supposed to bundle different, yet close, varieties: say language, gender, color preference, or you can snap 3 QR codes and generate a single QubeR code that has the capability to obfuscate one or more layers with an access code if wanted. i.e. this a the next-level complex QR coding capability.

## Distinguished Projects
### [Eglinton's Crosstown Light Rail Project (ECLRT)](https://www.metrolinx.com/en/projects-and-programs/eglinton-crosstown-lrt)
This project is with Crosslinx. From east to west, the Crosstown LRT connects with more transit across midtown better than ever before. From accessing TTC Line 1 at both Yonge and further west at Cedarvale, to linking with three GO Stations and a larger network of buses, the Crosstown LRT really serves the larger GTA community by reaching out across the entire region.

With 25 stops between Kennedy in the east and Mount Dennis in the west, residents and visitors alike will find it truly convenient to hop on the Crosstown LRT to access work, do errands, grab a bite, or visit friends across the city.

### [Montreal's Light Rail Project (REM)](https://rem.info/en/light-rail)
This project is with NouvLR. The RÃ©seau express mÃ©tropolitain (REM; lit.â€‰'Metropolitan Express Network') is a light metro rapid transit system in Greater Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It consists of five stations and connects Downtown Montreal with the suburb of Brossard. Extensions to the western Montreal suburbs and MontrÃ©alâ€“Trudeau International Airport are under construction and will open in stages between 2024 and 2027. A portion of the route was taken over from the Exo commuter rail Deux-Montagnes line and is being converted to light metro standards.

The 67-kilometre (42 mi) light metro rail system is projected to cost C$6.9 billion. It is independent of, but connects to and hence complements, the existing Montreal Metro, operated by the STM. Trains on the network are fully automated and driverless.

### [Keewatinohk Converter Station](https://www.hydro.mb.ca/corporate/facilities/converter_stations/#Keewatinohk)
This project was with Scheinder-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Manitoba Hydro, MB, Canada. The project is a multi-voltage converter station drawing the hydro power of the Nelson river and is a part of the power grid interconnection between the US and Canada.

My role was to deploy SE's proprietary `PACiS` system there.

### [Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority](http://septa.org/rebuilding/substation/morton.html)
This project was with Schneider-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), PA, USA. The project is a substation that serves the transportation power grid in Philadelphia, PA.

I was tasked to present a training session for SEPTA's staff on SE's proprietary `PACiS` system.

### [Information Technology & Communication Complex (ITCC)](https://www.albawani.net/project/itcc/)
This project was with Schnedier-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Al-Bawani, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The project is a mini IT city that should serve as a technology hub.

My mission in the project was to deploy multiple management systems to different functional buildings; `KNX` lighting control system, in addition to `BMS`, `DMS`, `EMS`, and `MMS` Systems; Building-, Data-, Energy-, and Measurement Management Systems.
